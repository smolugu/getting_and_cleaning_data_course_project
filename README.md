Calulate Mean and Standard Deviations on Data Collected from Subjects Wearing a smartphone and performing various activities
==========================================================================

## Data used for the analysis

Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The raw data used here represents data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

### Files in the Repo

* README.md : It gives information about the data used and steps performed to run the script, run_analysis.R, along with any assumptions about the data 

* CodeBook.md : It describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data and perform analysis

* run_analysis.R : It contains the script which cleans up the raw data and prepares the data to calculate mean and standard deviations.

### Steps to follow to replicate the data clean up and perform analysis

* The data from the above resource, download and unzipped, should be present in the current working directory along with the script file - run_analysis.R

* The script requires "dplyr" package installed in RStudio
*
